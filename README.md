# My Project

This project contains three tasks:

## Task 1: Historical Data API
A Flask API that returns historical data for BANKNIFTY, FINNIFTY, and NIFTY.

## Task 2: Algorithm Runner
A Flask API to start and stop a simulated algorithm process.

## Task 3: JSON Data Processing
A script to process and filter JSON data based on the latest date entries.

### Setup
1. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
2. Activate the virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage
- Run each task script as needed, e.g., `python task1.py` for the first task.
